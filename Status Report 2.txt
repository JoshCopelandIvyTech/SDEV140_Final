This program is a simple website scraper that searches for html img tags on a website and downloads them from their src. It then stores them in memory for either viewing or saving to local storage. 
So far I have the main logic for the web scraper done and most of the GUI logic done. I have a problem with the images sharing the same name in some situations, and the save as button not defaulting to the imageâ€™s name. So that needs to be worked on, along with finishing the save to local storage operation and some clean up.
